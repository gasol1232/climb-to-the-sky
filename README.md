## Running my project 
My game looks like the screenshot listed below. You can run it via clicking the link above or by open the index.html file on your browser. Once you open it or click it you are going to use your arrow keys to move the small figure all over the playground. Your goal is to make him reach out the sky on the top of the playground trying to get not touch by the enemy. Once the figure reachs the top the game gets reset and the figure goes back to the bottom of the playground.
